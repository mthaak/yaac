Description:  A simple class for bitmapped fonts in pygame.
              A bitmapped font is simply a font specified as a bitmap.
              Bitmapped fonts are easy to use, fast, and let you display fancy
              multicoloured text.  The characters are all the same size, so
              it's easy to treat the screen as a matrix of character cells, as
              if you were in text mode (e.g. for a status screen between
              levels).  Drawbacks are that you must of course draw the font
              yourself, you can't change the colour, and you don't get special
              effects like bold, italics, etc.
Requirements: Python 2.1, pygame 1.0
